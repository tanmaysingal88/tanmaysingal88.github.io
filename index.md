## 🔹 About Me
-Hi! I'm Tanmay Singal! I'm a quantum computing researcher based in University of Cologne with David Gross (https://qi.uni-koeln.de/).  My work is more on the theoretical side, and I work, in particular, on the mathematical aspects of quantum computing. Before being in Cologne, I worked as a postdoc with Dariusz Chruscinski in UMK, Torun (https://damsi.umk.pl/en/centre/quantum-entanglement-and-the-dynamics-of-open-quantum-systems/), Michal Oszmaniec in CFT Warsaw (https://quantin.pl/team/) and Huangjun Zhu (https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/13/75/c7605a136053/page.htm) in Fudan Univeristy, Shanghai. I completed my PhD. from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai (https://www.imsc.res.in/), India in 2016 under the guidance of Sibasish Ghosh.

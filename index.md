## 🔹 About Me
-Hi! I'm Tanmay Singal! I'm a quantum computing researcher based in University of Cologne with David Gross (https://qi.uni-koeln.de/). Before being in Cologne, I worked as a postdoc with Dariusz Chruscinski in UMK, Torun (https://damsi.umk.pl/en/centre/quantum-entanglement-and-the-dynamics-of-open-quantum-systems/), Michal Oszmaniec in CFT Warsaw (https://quantin.pl/team/) and Huangjun Zhu (https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/13/75/c7605a136053/page.htm) in Fudan Univeristy, Shanghai. I completed my PhD. from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai (https://www.imsc.res.in/), India in 2016 under the guidance of Sibasish Ghosh. 

## 🔹 Research areas and interests

-  My work is more on the theoretical side. A lot of my work deals with the mathematical aspects of quantum computing. The tools I routinely use in my work involve group theory, representation theory, concentration of measure, random matrix theory, and, of course, a lot of linear algebra! 
-  I also work in quantum algorithms and classical simulation of quantum random sampling experiments. 
- I have also worked in certification and and single-shot quanutm state discrimination.
